# Data Quality Tool Demo
We have three main functions of this tool, first one is date time format check and reformat, second one is to identify company type of the input organization name, the last one is 
address check, but for this one, we only check if the input address is valid and exists in our GCP database. Besides these tools, we also have a simple UI to show the summary information of each table of database and manipulate entry, for instance:add new entry to database, update previous entry and delete entry. Thank you for visiting!!

## Please sign in and select one function you want to apply in the left navigation bar.
